# Groupie tracker - filters

In this project, we implemented filters to the Groupie tracker. By clicking on the red button with slider icon at the top left corner of the page, you can open filters and filter groups by the creation year, by name, by concert dates, etc. Feel free to check it by yourself! ğŸ˜‰

The link to the audit questions is [>>> HERE <<<](https://github.com/01-edu/public/blob/master/subjects/groupie-tracker/filters/audit.md).

### Running the webpage

To start, please run the server, where the website will open.

! Please note, that the program has an interesting feature: if you don't want to use a standard port 8080 by default, you can use flag to choose your own port. Here is an example of how to use it: `go run . --port=1234`

To launch the server, please go to the destination folder using the terminal, and type the following to the command line:

`go run .`

After doing that, if you use Windows PC, you may see an alert, where you need to allow access for Windows Defender Firewall. Please do it.

Then, please open your web browser and type the following address in the address bar: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). 

Now you can open the website and check the results.ğŸ™‚
