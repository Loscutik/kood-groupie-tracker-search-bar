# Groupie tracker - Search bar

In this project, we implemented a search bar to the Groupie tracker. The search supports 5 options.

You can search by:

- Band / Artist name
- Band members
- Locations of concerts
- Date of the first album
- Band creation date


Just start typing, see hints in the dropdown menu, and click on the desired option. Feel free to check it by yourself! ğŸ˜‰

The link to the audit questions is [>>> HERE <<<](https://github.com/01-edu/public/blob/master/subjects/groupie-tracker/search-bar/audit.md).

### Running the webpage

To start, please run the server, where the website will open. To launch the server, please go to the destination folder using the terminal, and type the following to the command line:

`go run .`

After doing that, if you use Windows PC, you may see an alert, where you need to allow access for Windows Defender Firewall. Please do it.

Then, please open your web browser and type the following address in the address bar: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). 

Now you can open the website and check the results.ğŸ™‚
